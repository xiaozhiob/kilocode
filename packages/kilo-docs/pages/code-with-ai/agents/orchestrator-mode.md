# Orchestrator Mode: Coordinate Complex Workflows

Orchestrator Mode allows you to break down complex projects into smaller, manageable pieces. Think of it like delegating parts of your work to specialized assistants. Each subtask runs in its own context using a subagent (such as `general` for autonomous work or `explore` for codebase research) tailored for that specific job.

## Why Use Orchestrator Mode?

- **Tackle Complexity:** Break large, multi-step projects (e.g., building a full feature) into focused subtasks (e.g., design, implementation, documentation).
- **Use Specialized Agents:** Automatically delegate subtasks to the agent best suited for that specific piece of work, leveraging specialized capabilities for optimal results.
- **Maintain Focus & Efficiency:** Each subtask operates in its own isolated context with a separate conversation history. This prevents the parent (orchestrator) task from becoming cluttered with the detailed execution steps (like code diffs or file analysis results), allowing it to focus efficiently on the high-level workflow and manage the overall process based on concise summaries from completed subtasks.
- **Streamline Workflows:** Results from one subtask can be automatically passed to the next, creating a smooth flow (e.g., architectural decisions feeding into the coding task).

## How It Works

1.  Using Orchestrator Mode, Kilo can analyze a complex task and suggest breaking it down into a subtask.
2.  The parent task pauses, and the new subtask begins with a dedicated subagent.
3.  When the subtask's goal is achieved, Kilo signals completion.
4.  The parent task resumes with only the summary of the subtask. The parent uses this summary to continue the main workflow.

## Key Considerations

- **Approval Required:** By default, you must approve the creation and completion of each subtask. This can be automated via the [Auto-Approving Actions](/docs/getting-started/settings/auto-approving-actions#subtasks) settings if desired.
- **Context Isolation and Transfer:** Each subtask operates in complete isolation with its own conversation history. It does not automatically inherit the parent's context. Information must be explicitly passed:
  - **Down:** Via the initial instructions provided when the subtask is created.
  - **Up:** Via the final summary provided when the subtask finishes. Be mindful that only this summary returns to the parent.
- **Navigation:** Kilo's interface helps you see the hierarchy of tasks (which task is the parent, which are children). You can typically navigate between active and paused tasks.

Orchestrator Mode provides a powerful way to manage complex development workflows directly within Kilo Code, leveraging specialized agents for maximum efficiency.

Use subtasks to maintain clarity. If a request significantly shifts focus or requires a different expertise (mode), consider creating a subtask rather than overloading the current one.

Orchestrator mode uses the `task` tool to launch **subagent sessions**:

- The `task` tool creates a new child session. The agent name is specified as a parameter (e.g., `general`, `explore`, or custom subagent types you define).
- Child sessions are **fully isolated** — they run in their own conversation context and do not share message history with the parent.
- When the subagent completes its work, it returns a single message back to the parent orchestrator with the result.
- The parent orchestrator can launch multiple subagent sessions concurrently for parallel work.

In the legacy extension, orchestrator mode uses two tools to manage subtasks:

1. The [`new_task`](/docs/automate/tools/new-task) tool creates a subtask. Context is passed via the `message` parameter, and the subtask's mode is specified via the `mode` parameter (e.g., `code`, `architect`, `debug`).
2. When a subtask finishes, it calls [`attempt_completion`](/docs/automate/tools/attempt-completion). The summary is passed back to the parent via the `result` parameter.
